# rubbl-autocomplete

There are two demos in this repo.

## 1st Demo 
This is a straight rip-off from the Designspiration code with a modification to use static data delivered from an Express API.

Run ```npm i``` in the root directory to install dependencies
Then run ```npm start``` to start the API and serve up content at ```http://locahost:8080```.

## 2nd Demo
The second demo is a React-based app located in the ```app``` directory

Run ```cd ./app; npm i``` in the root directory to navigate to the ```app``` directory and install dependencies

Then, run ```yarn start``` to load the app!

**NOTE**: this code is not complete, but it shows off how to structure a fairly sophisticated HTML search form into testable, reusable components/modules.
